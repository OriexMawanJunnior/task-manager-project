# Task Manager Project

A simple task management application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on their status. This application is built using React with Redux for state management on the frontend, and Express for the backend API, with Axios for making HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a name, description, due date, and status.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks based on their status (All, Pending, Completed).
- **Responsive UI**: A clean and responsive user interface.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management library for JavaScript applications.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### Backend
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
